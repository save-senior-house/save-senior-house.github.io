		In Senior House, a common study break and community building activity is to barbeque <br> in the courtyard with some friends. The BBQ pit is not only a part of Senior <br> House culture, but a practical amenity to have for a building, yet the administration <br> found it to be wise to quietly rip it out of the ground.

		The tire swing was adorned to the tree in the Senior House courtyard by an alumnus <br> resident of the House a long time ago. Residents through the ages has swung on this <br> tire, and now it has been disrespectfully cut down, with no rhyme or reason.
