    <h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2016 the MIT administration announced its intervention into the Senior House community, citing low graduation rates and concerns about illegal drug use. The administration barred freshman from living in Senior House during school year 2016-2017 and appointed a turnaround committee in response.</p>
<p>At the end of the 2016-2017 school year, the administration decided that, due to “serious and unsafe” behaviors occurring in Senior House, all current residents were to be summarily ejected and replaced by a freshman program called Pilot 2021.</p>
<h2>Why we're upset:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Administration did not consider proposals put forward by students to address low graduation rates and other administrative concerns.</li>
<li>Taking longer than 4 or 6 years to graduate is not inherently wrong or bad, and insinuating so sends a dangerous message to students who may need to take time off.</li>
<li>The low graduation rate data point comes from students living in Senior House from 2008 and earlier (source). This data has nothing to do with current Senior House residents.</li>
<li>The idea that Senior House has a drug problem came from 1) unethically used survey data, 2) a very low response rate, somewhere around only 30 people (source) even responded to the survey, and even fewer people reported drug use.</li>
<li>Even if Senior House did have a drug problem, ripping residents from their community of support is not only dangerous, but wouldn't get rid of the problem; it would simply sweep it under the rug. This signals that MIT administrators care more about their public image than they do about the actual health and happiness of students.</li>
<li>The incident in house that prompted probation for the entire house, the cancellation of Steer Roast, and now depopulation, only involved a handful of Senior House residents. It is unfair and unprecedented to destroy a whole community of residents and alumni because of the actions of a few residents in house. Senior House does not condone the use or distribution of drugs.</li>
<li>We do not support the punishment of the whole community because of the actions of the few.</li>
<li>Residents who have not been found guilty in a COD proceeding have no reason to be barred from entering their own community.</li>
<li>Creating a new freshman dorm program without consulting DormCon or getting any student input at all is wrong, especially because students from across MIT consistently oppose the idea of freshman-only housing.</li>
<li>Administrators claimed they would keep the “positive aspects of senior house culture”, but getting rid of cats, possibly painting over murals, firing our GRTs (Graduate Resident Tutors) , installing RPMs (“Resident Peer Mentors”), filling the dorm up with almost all freshmen, forcing previous residents to fill out an insulting application for reentry into their own home, and the Pilot 2021 program go against not only senior house culture, but east side culture as a whole.</li>
<li>In particular, firing Senior House GRTs and not allowing student input into the hiring process for new GRTs destroys the bonds that help create a community.</li>
<li>Pilot2021 is offering meal kits at $9 per meal — and that's being marketed as "a more economical price". This is very out-of-touch with student budgets.</li>
</ul>
