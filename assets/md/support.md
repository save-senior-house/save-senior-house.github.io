## Open Letter in Support of Senior House ([Sign Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyNJ7wu5Fudw9Tvc6XLpA4qi2kZPMu3RMm7lcwyzlSTPvqMg/viewform))

Dear Chancellor Barnhart:
 
We, the undersigned MIT alumni, are writing to express our deep concern about the administration's plans regarding Senior House. Thousands of alumni, going back to the 1950s, are alarmed about the administration’s recent actions toward the dormitory.
 
As you may be aware, Senior House has a long and proud history at MIT. Senior House was MIT's very first student residence – it opened to students in 1918, at the end of World War I.
 
Senior House is beloved by generations of students, alumni, and faculty. We believe that the Senior House spirit represents the best of MIT. Its unique and irreplaceable culture and community -- and its continued existence -- are a source of great pride. The annual community-building event Steer Roast dates back to 1963 and is a part of MIT lore; Jerome Wiesner and Harold “Doc” Edgerton were among its earliest  supporters. Alumni of all ages still return to MIT to visit Senior House for the event each year, and many bring their children.
 
The Senior House community is a tight-knit community that developed organically, over the course of a hundred years. The actions of very few do not represent the spirited Senior House culture that we are so justly proud of. Nor do they represent the overwhelmingly vast majority of Senior House students, who have worked so hard on their academics and at building their own diverse community.
 
Senior House alumni are respected professors, doctors, engineers, startup founders, scientists, inventors, lawyers, and business leaders. We are successful not in spite of Senior House, but because of Senior House. For many of us, these communities made us feel, for the first time in our lives, supported and loved.
 
Senior House has always supported underrepresented minorities, and low-income and first-generation college students. A large percentage of Senior House students are from the LGBT community. The dormitory has always been a refuge for students who feel like they don’t fit in elsewhere on campus; for some of these students, Senior House was the first home they ever had.
 
The administration’s actions towards Senior House have been devastating to these students, and for student morale across the entire Institute. We feel that it is unnecessarily cruel to require students, who are already being forcibly evicted from their home, to complete an arduous re-application process to re-enter their beloved dormitory. We hope that you will take the concerns of these brilliant students seriously. We urge you to reconsider your decision.
 
Sincerely,
