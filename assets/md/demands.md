## Proposed Solutions to Improve Senior Houseâ€™s Academic Performance and Return to Policies that Reflect the Core Missions and Beliefs of MIT:

- Let the majority of SH residents live in Senior House by abolishing the application process.
- Transparency and genuine student input: All decisions made about the future of Senior House, or any other living group, should be done with the knowledge, input, and consent of the residents. 
- Continue the precedent of self-governance: Residents will be allowed to organize in-house government and will have an active role in choosing their GRTs. 
- Keep the positive aspects of Senior House culture intact; cat and mural policies should remain unchanged. Current murals should not be painted over. A specific effort should be made to preserve Senior House as a unique haven for students of color, LGBTQ+ students, and students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.
