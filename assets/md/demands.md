# Demands

Current residents of and confirmed transfer residents to Senior House will be allowed to move in in the fall, unless they have been found guilty for something in a formal COD proceeding. To require current residents to reapply for admittance to their previous residence diverges from the well-advertised choice-based residence structure, and the contents of the application place undue stress on students, especially in the case of finding faculty and staff recommendation during the summer.

## Pilot 2021

* Current residents and transfer students will be involved in the GRT selection process for the fall of 2017.
* Before fall 2017, the RA program will be removed, or, at the very least, revised in collaboration with current residents of the dorms in which it has been introduced. The current iteration of this program promotes peer policing, which is more harmful than good, as students will likely become more secretive about potentially dangerous behavior.
* Information will be released about who is reviewing applications to any aspect/program involved with Pilot 2021, as well as what grounds the applications are being evaluated on.
* Community values for the Pilot 2021 program will be revised with current Senior House resident collaboration to incorporate Senior House's existing values of taking care of each other, welcoming differences, individual freedom, and communal responsibility.
* Before fall 2017, the Pilot 2021 program as a whole will be reevaluated and revised in collaboration with current Senior House residents. To require reapplication for entry and be unclear as to what students will be signing up for by reapplying is unfair and removes agency in an ostensibly choice-based housing system.
* The positive aspects of Senior House's culture which administration and students have agreed upon will be at the center of whatever new community is built at Senior House.
* All aspects of the Pilot 2021 program will be clearly communicated to admitted freshmen, and any changes heretofore will also be communicated in a timely manner.
* Meal kits will not take policy precedence over Senior House's extant cook-for-yourself precedent.
* It will be clearly communicated to admitted students that meal kits are not mandatory, before the deadline to submit housing preferences.
* The turnaround wasn’t allowed to be fully implemented and wasn’t finished. The students’ work should not be disregarded and Pilot 2021 and the Senior House turnaround must not be mutually exclusive.

## Housing

* Freshman-only housing will not be a principle of MIT undergraduate housing going forward. Freshman-only housing is not only counter to developing tight-knit communities on campus, but also to freshman development without informal peer mentorship.
* Any housing changes in the future must be posted with advance notice while the fall, January, or spring terms are in session, i.e., when the most students are on campus. Additionally, there should be a period of time allotted in this space for student input (possibly through student government venues, e.g., DormCon) and potential revision.
* A commitment will be made on the part of the administration and Housing to maintain cook-for-yourself dorms as the more affordable option. Students should not be obligated to pay the Institute for food when they are capable of acquiring and preparing it themselves, especially if that comes at a lower cost to them.

## GRTs

* DormCon and current Senior House residents will be involved in crafting the new GRT description, for the fall of 2017 and onwards.
* In the future, changes will not be made to the GRT contract without current student and GRT input.

## Student-Administration Interaction

* To promote student involvement, and  accountability and transparency on all sides, any notes or minutes taken during meetings between student representatives and administrative employees will be allowed to be made public at any time after said meetings.
* Quantitative data used to inform policy decisions will be publicly released. Students who are having data collected about them, and having decisions about their lives at MIT made based on that data deserve to see said data. This will also require MIT to not only conduct data collection in an ethical manner, but to use it as such as well.

## Murals

* Extant murals in Senior House will be preserved, i.e., not whitewashed.
* Senior House will continue to be a dorm in which mural painting is allowed, according to its current mural policy.
* Murals will continue to be allowed and preserved in all other residences which currently have them, according to their respective mural policies.

## Cats

* Cats will continue to be permitted in Senior House, per their community rules. The decision to remove on-campus cats-permitted housing is not only arbitrary and directionless, it actively removes a source of de-stressing for students, and places undue stress on cat owners.
